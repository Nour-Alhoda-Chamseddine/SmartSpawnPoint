**SmartSpawnPoint** is a powerful and flexible Minecraft plugin that revolutionizes how player respawning works on your server. With region-based, world-based, and condition-based spawn points, you can create immersive experiences for your players that go far beyond the vanilla respawn mechanics.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Multiple Spawn Types:** Configure fixed, random, or weighted random spawn points
* **Region-Based Spawns:** Set different spawn points for different WorldGuard regions
* **World-Based Spawns:** Configure unique spawn points for each world
* **Conditional Spawns:** Use permissions and PlaceholderAPI to determine where players respawn
* **Safe Location Finding:** Automatically find safe locations for players to respawn
* **Waiting Room System:** Reduce lag with asynchronous safe location searching
* **Party System:** Allow players to form groups and respawn together
* **Walking Spawn Points:** Special players can respawn at their death location and serve as spawn points for others
* **Customizable Actions:** Execute commands and send messages on respawn
* **Highly Configurable:** Extensive configuration options to suit any server's needs
* **Auto-Update Check:** On server start, the plugin checks for updates. If a new version is available, a notification is displayed in the console

- `/smartspawnpoint party invite <player>` - Invites a player to your party (requires `smartspawnpoint.party.invite` permission)

- `/smartspawnpoint party setleader <player>` - Sets a new party leader (requires `smartspawnpoint.party.setleader` permission)
- `/smartspawnpoint party options` - Configures party options (requires `smartspawnpoint.party.options` permission)

## üîÑ How It Works

Are you still using spawn points from CMI or EssentialsX? Their spawn point systems were designed over a decade ago and haven't evolved much since. Isn't it time for something better?

Are you tired of players always respawning at the server spawn or their bed after death? Don't you think this mechanic is outdated and limiting for modern Minecraft servers?

SmartSpawnPoint revolutionizes player respawning with features like:

### üåç Region-Based Respawning
- Send players who die in a PvP arena directly to a spectator area
- Teleport players who die in a dungeon to a recovery zone with healing effects
- Make players who die in the wilderness respawn at random locations for added challenge

### üé≤ Weighted Random Spawns
- Create multiple possible spawn points with different probabilities
- Adjust spawn chances based on player permissions or PlaceholderAPI conditions
- Give VIP players better spawn locations with higher probability

### üë• Party System
- Allow players to form groups and respawn together
- Perfect for adventure maps, dungeons, and RPG servers
- Special "Walking Spawn Point" feature for content creators to keep their followers nearby

### üé¨ Content Creator Features
- Give your YouTubers and streamers the ability to create spawn point parties
- When they die, they respawn at their death location and act as spawn points for their followers
- Creates amazing opportunities for content creation and community engagement

### üîÑ Asynchronous Safe Location Finding
- The waiting room system prevents lag when finding safe spawn locations
- Players are temporarily teleported to a waiting area while the plugin searches for a safe location
- Perfect for random spawn points in unpredictable terrain

### üéÆ Enhanced Gameplay Experiences
- Send players to the Nether as punishment for dying in certain areas
- Create hardcore-like experiences where players respawn in completely random locations
- Design custom respawn experiences for different player ranks or achievements

### üî∞ Permission-Based Features

SmartSpawnPoint allows you to create tiered access to features based on player ranks or donation levels. Here's a complete list of permissions that you can assign in LuckPerms:

#### All Available Permissions

Copy these permissions into your LuckPerms editor (`/lp editor`) and assign them to appropriate groups:

```
smartspawnpoint.command
smartspawnpoint.reload
smartspawnpoint.party.invite
smartspawnpoint.party.accept
smartspawnpoint.party.deny
smartspawnpoint.party.leave
smartspawnpoint.party.list
smartspawnpoint.party.remove
smartspawnpoint.party.setleader
smartspawnpoint.party.options
smartspawnpoint.party.respawnatdeath
```

#### Suggested Permission Structure

- **Basic Players** (Default tier):
  ```
  smartspawnpoint.command
  smartspawnpoint.party.accept
  smartspawnpoint.party.deny
  smartspawnpoint.party.leave
  smartspawnpoint.party.list
  ```

- **VIP Players** (Middle tier):
  ```
  smartspawnpoint.party.invite
  smartspawnpoint.party.remove
  smartspawnpoint.party.setleader
  smartspawnpoint.party.options
  smartspawnpoint.vip
  ```

- **Premium/Content Creators** (Top tier):
  ```
  smartspawnpoint.party.respawnatdeath
  smartspawnpoint.premium
  ```

- **Administrators**:
  ```
  smartspawnpoint.reload
  ```

This tiered permission system creates progression and incentives for player ranks, enhancing both gameplay and monetization opportunities for your server. Players will have a reason to upgrade their rank to access more advanced party features and spawn benefits.

You can also configure special spawn points or weighted chances in your config based on these permissions:

```yaml
# Example of VIP-only spawn point
conditions:
  permissions:
    - "smartspawnpoint.vip"

# Example of weighted chances for premium players
weight-conditions:
  - type: "permission"
    value: "smartspawnpoint.premium"
    weight: 100  # 100% chance for premium players
```

SmartSpawnPoint isn't just a spawn point plugin - it's a complete respawn management system that opens up endless possibilities for your server!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Nether Teleportation**: If you want to teleport players to the Nether, refer to the example in the configuration. Make sure to set `require-safe: true` to avoid players spawning in dangerous locations.

2. **Region Entry vs Respawn**: SmartSpawnPoint only handles player respawning after death, not entry into regions or worlds. For region entry commands, use WorldGuard flags like `entry-command` or `entry-deny`. For first-join teleportation, consider using Multiverse-Core's `firstspawnoverride` setting.

3. **Compatibility with Other Plugins**: SmartSpawnPoint can potentially work alongside respawn handling from CMI or EssentialsX if properly configured, but it's recommended to disable their respawn handling for the best experience:
   - For EssentialsX: Set `respawn-at-home: false` in the essentials config.yml
   - For CMI: Set `respawn.enabled: false` in the CMI config.yml

4. **Safe Location Finding**: The `require-safe` option should be set to `false` for known safe locations to improve performance. Only enable it when spawning in potentially dangerous areas.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the plugin:

1. **Check your configuration**: Validate your YAML syntax using [YAMLLint](http://www.yamllint.com/)
2. **Enable debug mode**: Set `debug-mode: true` in the config to get detailed logs
3. **Check for conflicts**: Ensure no other plugins are handling respawn events
4. **Verify dependencies**: Make sure you have the correct versions of WorldGuard and PlaceholderAPI if you're using those features
5. **Plugin conflicts**: Avoid configuring SmartSpawnPoint respawn mechanics in regions or worlds that are already managed by plugins like MythicDungeons. These plugins often have their own respawn handling, which can conflict with SmartSpawnPoint.
6. **Delayed teleportation**: If you're experiencing issues with other plugins that handle teleportation or respawning, try setting `force-delayed-teleport: true` in the config. This can help resolve timing conflicts by ensuring SmartSpawnPoint's teleportation happens after other plugins have processed the respawn event.
